More information   
Scam sites that contain misleading content will often trick people into trusting them by pretending to be sites from well-known companies. If you visit a scam site and do what it suggests, you might be putting your sensitive information—like passwords, credit card numbers, contact info, or other financial data—at risk. Learn more

Scam sites often run pop-up loops and play loud audio to convince you that contacting them is a good idea. If you interact with a scammer, whether online or by phone, you run the risk of disclosing sensitive financial data and personal info, which could result in loss of money. Your best option is to close the webpage or hang up the phone. If in doubt, go back.
